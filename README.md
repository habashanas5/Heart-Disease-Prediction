# Project Report: Predictive Modeling for Heart Disease Risk Assessment
## 1. Introduction
### The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of heart disease based on various health-related features. The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals, including their demographics, lifestyle choices, and health conditions. The project involves exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and the implementation of various machine learning models to predict heart disease risk.

## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
### 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Data Overview: The dataset consists of several features, including BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and more. Initial exploration involved checking data types, detecting missing values, and exploring statistical measures.

#### Data Visualization: Histograms, count plots, and correlation matrices were used for visualizing the distribution of features and understanding relationships between variables. This exploration helped identify patterns and potential correlations.

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing
#### Handling Duplicates: Duplicate rows were removed to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
#### Label Encoding: Categorical features were encoded using label encoding to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.

## 3. Data Balancing
#### To address potential class imbalance, techniques like oversampling or undersampling could be applied. However, the implementation of these techniques is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code.

## 4. Model Implementation
### 4.1 Model Selection
#### Random Forest Classifier: A Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and provide feature importances.
#### Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression, a simple and interpretable model, was also implemented for comparison.

### 4.2 Training and Evaluation
#### The dataset was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

#### Models were trained using the training set and evaluated on the test set.

## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
#### Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV for several classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others.

#### Best hyperparameters were selected based on performance metrics.

## 6. Model Evaluation
### 6.1 Performance Metrics
#### Confusion Matrix: Used to evaluate True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) values.

#### Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score: These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

#### ROC Curve and AUC: Used to assess the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

#### Precision-Recall Curve: Examines the trade-off between precision and recall.

## 7. Ensemble Learning
#### Ensemble methods such as Voting Classifier, Bagging, Pasting, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost were implemented and compared for improved predictive performance.

## 8. Model Selection and Interpretation
#### The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and other relevant metrics. Feature importances were analyzed to understand the variables contributing most to the predictions.

9. Hyperparameter Optimization with RandomizedSearchCV
A RandomizedSearchCV approach was implemented for hyperparameter optimization, considering the distribution of hyperparameter values.
