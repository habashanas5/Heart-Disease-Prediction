The project successfully developed predictive models for heart disease risk assessment. Through a systematic approach involving data exploration, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation, the best-performing model was identified. The use of ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning contributed to achieving optimal predictive performance.
Data Overview: The dataset consists of several features, including BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and more. Initial exploration involved checking data types, detecting missing values, and exploring statistical measures.
Data Visualization: Histograms, count plots, and correlation matrices were used for visualizing the distribution of features and understanding relationships between variables. This exploration helped identify patterns and potential correlations.
Handling Duplicates: Duplicate rows were removed to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
Label Encoding: Categorical features were encoded using label encoding to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Data Balancing : To address potential class imbalance, techniques like oversampling or undersampling could be applied. However, the implementation of these techniques is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code.

Training and Evaluation:
The dataset was split into training, testing, and validation sets.
Models were trained using the training set and evaluated on the test set.

4. Model Implementation
Random Forest Classifier: A Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and provide feature importances.
Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression, a simple and interpretable model, was also implemented for comparison.
Ensemble methods such as Voting Classifier, Bagging, Pasting, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost were implemented and compared for improved predictive performance.

4.2 Training and Evaluation
The dataset was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

Models were trained using the training set and evaluated on the test set.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV for several classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others.

Best hyperparameters were selected based on performance metrics.

6. Model Evaluation
Confusion Matrix: Used to evaluate True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) values.
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score: These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
ROC Curve and AUC: Used to assess the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
Precision-Recall Curve: Examines the trade-off between precision and recall.

Hyperparameter Optimization with RandomizedSearchCV
A RandomizedSearchCV approach was implemented for hyperparameter optimization, considering the distribution of hyperparameter values
